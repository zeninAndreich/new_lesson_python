 Rock, substituting his chest under the waves,
It's worth it, it's open to all winds.
Is there anything in the world,
What would be stronger than granite?

The answer to this was given by science
More from a hundred years away:
— Stronger than granite — titanium metal
And solid steel grades.

And harder? Do not squint your eyes inquisitively,
The answer is also known:
— Stronger than steel and titanium — diamond. —
Let it be so. Well, we have on earth
Is there anything harder than diamond?

Yes, there is one substance on earth,
And it has nothing to do with science:
Everyone is stronger and it was and it should be
The firm word of a friend!
